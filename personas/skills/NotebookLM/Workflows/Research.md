# Research Workflow

Use NotebookLM's research agents to search the web or Google Drive, then optionally import findings as notebook sources.

Running the **Research** workflow in the **NotebookLM** skill to run research agent...

## Pre-check

Ensure a notebook is active. If not, create one first via CreateNotebook workflow.
