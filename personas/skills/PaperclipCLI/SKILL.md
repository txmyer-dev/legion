# PaperclipCLI

CLI interface for managing the Paperclip agent orchestration platform. Dispatch tasks, wake agents, manage issues, and check status — all from the terminal.

## Prerequisites

**First-time setup:** Clone and install the CLI tool:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/PaperclipCLI && git clone https://github.com/txmyer-dev/cli-anything-paperclip.git repo
cd repo && pip install -e .
```

**Environment variables** (set in shell profile or per-session):
```bash
export PAPERCLIP_URL="https://thecrowbarcrew.cc"
export PAPERCLIP_API_KEY="<agent-api-key>"
export PAPERCLIP_COMPANY_ID="1c1a6b91"
```

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Dispatch** | "dispatch to agent", "send task to Builder", "tell Scout to" | `Workflows/Dispatch.md` |
| **Status** | "agent status", "what are agents doing", "paperclip status" | `Workflows/Status.md` |
| **Agents** | "list agents", "manage agents", "wake agent" | `Workflows/Agents.md` |
| **Issues** | "create issue", "list issues", "assign issue" | `Workflows/Issues.md` |

## Quick Reference

**Agents available (Ekko-as-CEO roster):**
- **Builder** (Sonnet) — code, PRs, deploys, infrastructure, DNS, SSL, CI/CD, bug fixes
- **Scout** (Sonnet) — research, analysis, OSINT, competitive intelligence, technical evaluation
- **Writer** (Sonnet) — content, blog posts, newsletters, social media, SecondBrain entries
- **Watchdog** (Haiku) — monitoring, health check investigation (event-driven only, woken by n8n)

**Key design principles:**
- All agents are event-driven (no heartbeat polling)
- Two-tier triage: n8n keyword routing (70%) → Ekko handles ambiguous (30%)
- Agents deliver to Ekko (QA gate), not directly to Tony
- Architecture: n8n triggers → keyword route or Ekko triage → Paperclip dispatch → agent executes

## Examples

**Example 1: Dispatch a task to an agent**
```
User: "Tell Builder to fix the client health check"
→ Invokes Dispatch workflow
→ Creates issue, assigns to Builder, wakes Builder
→ Reports issue ID and agent status
```

**Example 2: Check what agents are doing**
```
User: "What's the paperclip status?"
→ Invokes Status workflow
→ Lists all agents with current state, last activity, spend
→ Shows pending issues and approvals
```

**Example 3: Wake an agent for a specific reason**
```
User: "Wake up Writer to draft the weekly newsletter"
→ Invokes Agents workflow
→ Sends wakeup request with reason
→ Confirms agent is active
```
